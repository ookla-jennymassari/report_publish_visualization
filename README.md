# report_publish_visualization
Description:

As a customer I would like an email notification with the rootscore results when they are available so that we can trigger internal groups to review the data.

Need this for the first 2H 2024 market ~ July 20, 2025,

Acceptance Criteria:

Email should be sent at Report Publish

Email should be sent to all the same recipients that get the current consumer report preview - @Gale Kicha can you provide the list.

The required report should be in the body of the email (this can be based on the Rootscore Summary Report) - @Ed Luschei can help flush out the details on this.

We can stop pushing consumer report previews to rootmetrics.com
